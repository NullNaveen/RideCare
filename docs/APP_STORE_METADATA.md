## Description (4000 characters)

**RideCare is the smart way to track your bike's maintenance and never miss a service again.**

Designed for riders of BS6-generation bikes with Bluetooth connectivity (TVS, Royal Enfield, Hero, Bajaj), RideCare automatically tracks your trips, calculates maintenance due dates, and sends timely reminders — all without manual logging.

### WHY RIDECARE?

🛣️ **Automatic Trip Tracking**
No more forgetting to log rides. RideCare uses GPS to automatically detect when you're riding and tracks distance in the background (battery-optimized).

🔧 **Smart Maintenance Reminders**
Get notified when oil changes, chain lubrication, tyre checks, or major services are due — based on both distance (odometer) and time elapsed.

📴 **Offline-First Design**
All data stored locally on your device. Cloud sync is optional (Pro feature). Your privacy comes first.

🔗 **Bluetooth Pairing (Pro)**
Connect to your bike's Bluetooth OBD to auto-sync odometer and speed data. No manual entry needed.

📊 **Trip History**
View detailed trip logs with maps, distance, duration, and speed. Export to CSV for expense tracking.

🧾 **Receipt Storage (Pro)**
Snap photos of service receipts and attach them to maintenance records. Never lose a warranty document again.

### FEATURES

- Automatic GPS trip tracking
- Manual odometer entry
